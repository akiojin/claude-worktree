# Specification Quality Checklist: カスタムAIツール対応機能

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items passed validation**

### Content Quality
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ No mention of specific programming languages, frameworks, or APIs
- ✅ Written for business stakeholders to understand the feature value
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Out of Scope) are complete

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found - all requirements are fully specified
- ✅ All requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by providing invalid JSON and verifying error message)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-001: "30秒以内に起動", SC-002: "100%検出")
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- ✅ All user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with preconditions, actions, and expected results
- ✅ Edge cases are clearly identified (5 edge cases listed)
- ✅ Scope is bounded with clear "範囲外" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions are documented

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements map to user stories and acceptance criteria
- ✅ 5 user stories cover all primary flows (P1: setup and launch, P2: execution modes, P3: advanced features)
- ✅ 6 success criteria provide measurable outcomes
- ✅ No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`. No updates required.
