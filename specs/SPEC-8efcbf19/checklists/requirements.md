# Specification Quality Checklist: Docker/root環境でのClaude Code自動承認機能

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality
✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses on user needs and business value without implementation details. All sections describe "what" and "why" rather than "how".

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **Pass** - All requirements are clear and testable:
- FR-001: Specific test method (process.getuid() === 0)
- FR-002-005: Clear conditions and expected behaviors
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

### Success Criteria
✅ **Pass** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Verifiable outcome (no error, no permission prompts)
- SC-002: Verifiable outcome (warning message displayed)
- SC-003: Verifiable outcome (environment variable not set, existing behavior maintained)
- SC-004: Verifiable outcome (system operates without error)

### Edge Cases
✅ **Pass** - Three important edge cases identified:
1. Root user detection failure
2. IS_SANDBOX=1 future compatibility
3. Error handling when Claude Code rejects the environment variable

### Scope and Boundaries
✅ **Pass** - Scope is clearly defined with explicit out-of-scope items:
- Out of scope: Official support, non-Docker usage, Windows implementation

### Dependencies and Assumptions
✅ **Pass** - All critical dependencies and assumptions documented:
- Dependencies: Node.js APIs, execa, Claude Code CLI
- Assumptions: Docker environment, user understanding of security risks

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
