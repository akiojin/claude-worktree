# Specification Quality Checklist: 一括ブランチマージ機能

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ **No implementation details**: The spec avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, Ink.js, or specific code structures. Git commands are mentioned only in functional requirements where necessary to describe the operation, not the implementation.
- ✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate the value to developers (time savings, risk reduction, automation).
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language that business stakeholders can understand.
- ✅ **Mandatory sections**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Out of Scope) are present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are clear without [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. Reasonable defaults were chosen (e.g., merge method, priority order, error handling).
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through testing (e.g., FR-001: press 'p' key → function launches).
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "5 branches in under 1 minute", SC-007: "80% time reduction").
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of frameworks or tools in SC section, only user-facing outcomes.
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 1-4 concrete acceptance scenarios with preconditions, actions, and expected results.
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented (e.g., 0 branches, all conflicts, cancel during execution).
- ✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear "Out of Scope" section lists 9 items not included (e.g., interactive conflict resolution, rebase operations).
- ✅ **Dependencies listed**: 4 dependencies identified (git.ts, worktree.ts, BranchListScreen, git CLI).

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: FR-001 through FR-015 each map to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories.
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: 4 user stories cover basic merge (P1), dry-run (P2), auto-push (P3), and progress display (P1).
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 7 success criteria define measurable targets for performance, accuracy, and user experience.
- ✅ **No leaked implementation**: Spec focuses on "what" and "why", not "how" (no class names, function signatures, or architectural decisions).

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Recommendations**:
- Consider adding a user story for keyboard shortcuts or help display (priority P4) in future iterations
- May want to clarify if dry-run mode should attempt merge in a temporary worktree or use git's --no-commit flag (can be decided during planning)
